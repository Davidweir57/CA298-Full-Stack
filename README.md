# CA298 Full Stack

This project was made as part of my 2nd year Full Stack Development module. This repo contains the files for both the frontend and backend code for an online store website.

The shop:

      - utilises Django API rest framework
      - allows users to sign in and log in
      - tracks users' total price and current shopping basket
      - allows for a difference between user customers and admins
      - allows admins to add and remove items from the store

As well as a number of other features.
